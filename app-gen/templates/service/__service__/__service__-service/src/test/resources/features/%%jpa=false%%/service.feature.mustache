Feature: Tests the {{service}} Service using a REST client. 
 
  Scenario: Trial test. Change it according to the actual service
{{#security}}
    When I construct a REST request with authorization header in realm "tenant0" for user "t0-premium" and password "t0-premium"
    And I construct a REST request with header "x-chenile-tenant-id" and value "tenant0"
    And I POST a REST request to URL "/{{service}}/op1" with payload
{{/security}}
{{^security}}
    When I POST a REST request to URL "/{{service}}/op1" with payload
{{/security}}
    """
    {
	 
	}
	"""
	Then the REST response key "id" is "{{Service}}ServiceImpl"
