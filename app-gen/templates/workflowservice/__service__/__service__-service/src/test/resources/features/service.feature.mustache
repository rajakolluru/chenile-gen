Feature: Tests the Chenile Workflow Service using a REST client. {{Service}} service exists and is under test.
It helps to create a {{service}} and manages the state of the {{service}} as follows:
OPENED -(assign) -> ASSIGNED -(resolve) -> RESOLVED -(close) -> CLOSED
 
  Scenario: Test create {{service}}
{{#security}}
    When I construct a REST request with authorization header in realm "tenant0" for user "t0-premium" and password "t0-premium"
    And I construct a REST request with header "x-chenile-tenant-id" and value "tenant0"
{{/security}}
    When I POST a REST request to URL "/{{service}}" with payload
    """
    {
	    "openedBy": "USER1",
	    "description": "Description"
	}
	"""
    Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
    And store "$.payload.mutatedEntity.id" from  response to "id"
    And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" is "OPENED"
    And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.openedBy" is "USER1"
    And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.description" is "Description"
	  
	Scenario: Retrieve the {{service}} that just got created
