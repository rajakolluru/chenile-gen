Feature: {{Batch}} Test - Test the {{batch}} initiation process
Scenario: Init the first trigger

When I POST a REST request to URL "/{{batch}}/firstTrigger" with payload
"""json
{
}
"""
Then the REST response contains key "id"
And store "$.payload.id" from response to "id"

Scenario: Retrieve all the children of this process
When I GET a REST request to URL "/processChildren/${id}"
#Then the REST expression "payload" size is 7
